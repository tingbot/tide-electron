## How to setup a development environment

### Windows

This project uses Node.js, Python 2.7 and some modules. For now, these have to be manually installed.  

* Download Node 6 from: https://nodejs.org/en/
* Install python 2.7.* from: https://www.python.org/  
  **IMPORTANT:** During the installation there is an opt-in to add Python to the path variable. You have to do this otherwise the project can't find Python. If you get errors later call ``setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python33\Scripts"`` from the terminal. This will add Python to your path.
* If you don't have Visual Studio installed, `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`

### Mac

Node v6 is required to build and run, and some custom flags to build.

* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* `brew install node`
* Install [nvm](http://nvm.sh)
* ``nvm install 6``
* ``export CXXFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.9" LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.9"``

## Running

 * ``nvm install 6``
 * ``npm run build-python``
 * ``npm install``
 * ``./node_modules/.bin/webpack``
 * ``npm run dev`` (this will run webpack watching for changes while starting the app)
